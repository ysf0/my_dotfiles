- fedora Workstation
  
  1- for daily use. because:
     - privacyguides.org easiest recommendation for end-user.
     - Gnome comes pure as possible.

  2- run Flatpak apps via live-OS (normally Flatpak may require restart or config which is not possible on live-OS).

- gparted live OS

  AFAIK there is no "gparted GUI" is included any other distro on my list. In case any offline environment I may need this app. (even if exist this is extremly minimal OS which can start on every machine)

- MX Linux Fluxbox

  MX Linux has extra features even on live-OS:
  - some extra codecs and apps like VLC.
  - Automatic enabling of most Broadcom drivers
  - Increased support for realtek wifi devices
  - antiX (support for old and limited resource hardwares) live system

  source: https://mxlinux.org/current-release-features/

- mx linux KDE

  Fluxbox is very light, but KDE offers more integration tools (like bluetooth, multi-monitor) on desktop environment.

- tails

  Run any app via tor:
  
  > torsocks yt-dlp "www.youtube.com/video123"

- Ubuntu

  1- it has largest market share. so an app may only work on this.

  2- run Snap apps via live-OS (normally Snap may require restart or config which is not possible on live-OS).

- ventoy

  in any case I want to install ventoy to another USB.

- Win10_22H2_EnglishInternational_x64v1

  windows 11 has requirements on installations. it makes difficult to install on VM. I use this iso for VM. 

- windows_11__23H2__english_international__x64_v2

  personal computer installation.
