# APPS INSIDE FEDORA

# partition manager
- blivet-gui
  - dnf
  - gparted and gnome-disk-utility does not support LVM and btrfs

- gparted
  - dnf
  - gnome-disk-utility does not shot long partition names + and not show flags

- gnome-disk-utility (OS'un UI menüsünde sadece "disks" olarak geçiyor)
  - default installed on Fedora.
  - fstab dosyasının mount-point bilgisini update edebilmemiz sağlıyor. Diğer UI uygulamaları bunu yapamıyor.

note-1: btrfs is the default file-system on Fedora.

note-2: gparted can format the volume as btrfs but it can not show or sub-volmes/groups of it.

note-3: blivet-gui btrfs volume'un re-size'ını seçtirtmiyor (bu bir bug olabilir). fakat bu işlem gparted ile yapılabiliyor. Aslında çok basit görevleri biri yaparken diğeri yapamıyor. Bu sebeple her 3 uygulamayı da kullanmak şart.

# http clients
- Hoppscotch (Downloads are available on from different repository) (appimage)
- insomnia (appimage)

# Hoppscotch vs insomnia
- both have support for pre-request and post-request (test) scripts via JavaScript.
- insomnia has more pre-request script snippets (templates/examples).
- insomnia has quick templates (feature name: "generator tag") to change a filed on body via setting random number, timestamp etc... You can do that this manually on Hoppscotch via pre-request scripts via JavaScript (but it takes time little bit).
- insomnia has gRPC support, but Hoppscotch not.

# postman
postman shows gRPC "metadata" on response. insomnia does not.

- Do not use:
  - "bruno" which is lightweight of insomnia (they already mention on their github readme)
  - firecamp has few contributors.
  - all others are proprietary (except command-line based)

# BROWSERS
- Firefox
  - native is installed by default on Fedora.
  - only install Flatpak when there are compability issues with Native Firefox. Example: Microsoft-Teams web page only works with Firefox Flatpak build. It does not work with native Firefox.
  - When install from Flatpak use "Flathub" as remote. (for betrer codec support)
  - When both native and Flatpak has been installed, shortcuts may conflict. 
  
    Run the flatpak via:

    > flatpak run org.mozilla.firefox

    Or Gnome menu shortcut will start flatpak firefox.

    To start native-firefox run:

    > /usr/bin/firefox

    or just:

    > firefox

    Flatpak-firefox use profile directory as: $HOME/.var/org.mozilla.firefox

- net.mullvad.MullvadBrowser
  - flatpak
- io.github.ungoogled_software.ungoogled_chromium (does not include any privacy patch.)
  - flatpak
  - appimage (is 3rd party. prefer flatpak.)
- chromium
  - do not install the packages of woolyss.
  - do not install https://flathub.org/apps/org.chromium.Chromium
  - portable version should be download manually: https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium/#not-as-easy-steps
  - dnf install chromium (explained here: https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/installing-chromium-or-google-chrome-browsers/)

# APPS INSIDE VIRTUAL MACHINE WITH GUEST FEDORA:
- google chrome (for compability issues or tests)
  - rpm (because does not need any video codec)
- teamviewer
  - rpm (because portable version not working)
- opera (for free VPN)
  - snap (because Snap build does not need any video coded. if you will install rpm or deb version you will need to read below note)
- brave browser (officialy supports TOR. in case any compability problem happens with TOR-Browser.)
  - flatpak ve snap are still beta.

# Opera browser video codec
libffmpeg.so is licenced codec for videos. but it has different versions and different builds. libffmpeg for the new chromium/chrome builds does not work on new opera versions. therefore you need to find specific build of libffmpeg.so for opera.

For example this build works for Opera 63.0.3x: https://github.com/iteufel/nwjs-ffmpeg-prebuilt/releases/download/0.39.2/0.39.2-linux-x64.zip

# Flatpak video codecs
- Do not prefer remote "Fedora", always prefer "Flathub". because of licence issues, Flathub distributed app has more codec support.
- Flatpak apps may use codecs from below apps. Therefore install if you don't have already:

  - flatpak install --system flathub org.videolan.VLC
  - flatpak install --system flathub org.freedesktop.Platform.gstreamer
  - flatpak install --system flathub org.freedesktop.Platform.VAAPI.Intel
  - flatpak install --system flathub org.freedesktop.Platform.VAAPI.Intel.i386
  - flatpak install --system flathub org.freedesktop.Platform.ffmpeg-full
  - flatpak install --system flathub org.freedesktop.Platform.openh264
  - flatpak install --system flathub org.freedesktop.Platform.GL.default

- Always pass --system to all apps. Because:
  - they will be able to read codecs of others (if exist).
  - if any new user will be created on OS the new user will not need to imnstall again all apps.

# DOWNLOADED INSTALLERS
CRITICAL_APPS: in case any offline environment. 

tor-browser and brave-browser are the exceptions (in case download may blocked by ISP, but it works if you downloaded already).

brave-browser doesn't get as much attention as tor-browser for being installed or running on OS. Therefore I had a backup of it. (normally tor-browser is enough).
